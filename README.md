*tech*

I'm an engineer and researcher interested in bridging big tech, web3 and quant finance together. 

Recently worked on quantitative risk engineering in decentralized finance after quantitative research position in automated options trading. Before that I was working on operations research/engineering at a taxi company. You can find out more about my work history from my [resume](https://github.com/oxue/oxue.github.io/raw/main/public/Resume%20Oliver%20Xu.pdf).

Also currently advisor on algorithmic trading strategy for [a web3 startup](https://elixir.finance/), along with some of the OGs in the quant research space.
