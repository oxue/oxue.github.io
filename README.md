**tech**

I'm an engineer and researcher interested in bridging big tech, web3 and quant finance together. 

I did my undergrad at Waterloo. I took a double major in Combinatorics/Optimzation and Computer Science. I've got a minor in psychology.

Recently worked on risk engineering in decentralized finance after quantitative research position in automated options trading. Before that I was working on operations research/engineering at a taxi company. You can find out more about my work history from my [resume](https://github.com/oxue/oxue.github.io/raw/main/public/Resume%20Oliver%20Xu.pdf).

Also currently advisor on algorithmic trading strategy for [a web3 startup](https://elixir.finance/).

Recently I started writing about quant finance on [substack](https://quante.substack.com/).
